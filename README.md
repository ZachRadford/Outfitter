# Outfitter
=========
**Outfitter** is a "World of Warcraft Addon" to easily manage you gear outfits.

This is just the 4.2.6 version by John Stephen with an added "Export" mod.
Out of boredom I added such feature so everyone writing a "Class Guide" can easily export their outfits with embedded web-database URLs (like wowhead/wow-one/wutevah)

Hope you will enjoy it!

> **NOTE:**
>
> - This Addon is developed for WoW 2.4.3 (toc 20400), also known as TBC WoW

Usage
-----
Just bring-out the classic **?**</i> `Outfitter's DropDownMenu` and you will find the "Export" submenu there.

Should be self explanatory really.

Alternatively, type /outfitter command in your chat and you should get a nice help there, about slashcommands available.

Yes, I added those too!
